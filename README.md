# SparsDT

SparsDT is a new statistical dictionary learning algorithm for sparse signals that is based on an l√©vy alpha-stable innovation model. The algorithm can be used to learn a sparse representation of the Signal. 
The code can be run in both CPU and GPU.



### Dependencies
---
To use the code use python3.7 and install the required packages in the requirement.txt file,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To start, you might want to look at the notebook
